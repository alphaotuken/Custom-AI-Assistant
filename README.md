# This is a custom ChatGPT bot that is kinda like Jarvis
### I undertook a personal project with the goal of creating an AI similar to Jarvis from Tony Stark's technology. While my final product falls short of the sophistication of Jarvis, the experience provided me with a deeper appreciation for the complexity involved in developing an effective AI assistant tool.

Written in Python, libraries used were:

* pyChatGPT - https://github.com/terry3041/pyChatGPT
* SpeechRecognition - https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/
* PYTTSX3 - https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
* There are 2 modes: Chat and Voice

- Chat

You can type in anything and it will respond in text. Typing "stop" will end the chat.

- Voice

You can say anything and with SpeechRecognition it will turn your speech into text and then ask ChatGPT what you said and it will respond in a voice and text for hearing and visual output. You can also say things like "stop", "goodbye", "bye", "exit", "quit" to exit the program by voice, or just exiting out.
I want to add more functionality to it, since the ChatGPT only knows 2021 and past, so you can't ask it about the weather or what not, but I want to add kind of a term based questioning for common things. Like if you ask something and it contains the word "weather" it will reply with a different api like a weather api and completely forget about the chatgpt. I am hoping with more release the better I can make this.
